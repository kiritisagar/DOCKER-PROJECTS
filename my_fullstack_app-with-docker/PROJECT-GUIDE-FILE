Based on your history, let's streamline the commands and focus on the ones that are relevant and necessary for setting up and running your Dockerized application (`my_fullstack_app-with-docker`):

1. **Clone Repository and Navigate to Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd
   git clone https://github.com/kiritisagar/DOCKER-PROJECTS.git
   cd DOCKER-PROJECTS/my_fullstack_app-with-docker
   ```

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**
   - Install Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
     ```
   - Verify Docker installation:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - Install Docker Compose (ensure you have the correct version):
     ```bash
     sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     ```
   - Verify Docker Compose installation:
     ```bash
     docker-compose --version
     ```

3. **Build and Start Docker Containers:**
   - Build Docker containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build --no-cache
     ```
   - Start Docker containers in detached mode:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

4. **Verify Container Status:**
   - Check running containers:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - Check Docker Compose service status:
     ```bash
     docker-compose ps
     ```

5. **Troubleshoot Database Container Issues:**
   - If the database container (`my_fullstack_app-with-docker_db_1`) does not start or exits with an error, check its logs:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs db
     ```
   - Investigate the logs to identify any errors during startup.

6. **Ensure `init.sql` File Accessibility:**
   - Ensure that the `init.sql` file is correctly placed and accessible within the `db` service configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Adjust file permissions if necessary:
     ```bash
     chmod 644 ./db/init.sql
     ```

These steps should help you effectively set up and troubleshoot your Dockerized full-stack application. Adjustments may be needed based on specific errors or issues encountered during the setup process. If you encounter any specific errors or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
